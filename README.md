# Descry Tech: A Visual Approach to Algorithm Education through Collaborative Development
## Abstract
Descry Tech is a web-based platform designed to teach the functioning of algorithms through interactive visual programming. The project was inspired by the challenges associated with learning computer science, particularly in understanding complex algorithms. Utilizing Node.js, React, and Docker for frontend development and deployment, along with Java and Processing for the creation of executable JAR files, Descry Tech aims to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical application. This document discusses the project's development process, focusing on the challenges faced by the team members with diverse skill sets and limited experience in collaborative software development.

## 1. Introduction
Algorithm education is a critical aspect of computer science, as it forms the foundation for efficient problem solving and data manipulation. However, many students struggle to grasp the concepts and inner workings of algorithms due to their abstract nature. Descry Tech was developed to address this issue, providing a website that offers visual demonstrations and explanations of various algorithms, making them more accessible and understandable.

## 2. Technical Implementation
### 2.1 Frontend Development and Deployment
The frontend of Descry Tech was built using Node.js and React, providing a seamless user interface (UI) and efficient navigation through the platform. Docker was employed for containerization and deployment, ensuring that the platform can be consistently and reliably run across different environments.

### 2.2 Algorithm Visualization Programs
To offer an interactive learning experience, the Descry Tech platform includes executable JAR files, created using Java and the Processing library. These files, when downloaded and run on a user's computer, provide visual demonstrations of various algorithms, enabling users to visualize their function and understand the underlying principles.

## 3. Challenges and Collaboration
### 3.1 Diverse Skill Sets and Limited Overlap
The Descry Tech development team comprised members with diverse skill sets: one with a strong background in Java, another with extensive frontend experience, a third with expertise in deployment, and a fourth member with proficiency in Processing and GUI development. Despite the limited overlap in skills, the team needed to work together effectively to build a cohesive and functional platform.

### 3.2 Overcoming Challenges
The team addressed these challenges by dividing the work into distinct components, with each member focusing on their area of expertise. Regular communication and code reviews were crucial in ensuring that the components worked together seamlessly. Moreover, members took the opportunity to learn from one another, broadening their skill sets and gaining a better understanding of the project as a whole.

### 4. Conclusion
Descry Tech serves as an innovative approach to algorithm education, offering an interactive, visual platform that makes complex concepts more accessible. The project highlights the importance of collaboration, communication, and adaptability in overcoming the challenges of diverse skill sets and limited experience working together. As a result, Descry Tech not only provides an invaluable learning resource but also stands as a testament to the potential of interdisciplinary teamwork in software development.
